categories: ios web

Along with 3 other students from EPITA, we're working on an intranet for our school.

The intranet contains old courses, quizzes, midterms and finals.
The main goal of this intranet is to get together all the documents and
make it available for new students.

EpiPortal was founded by [Julien Dubiel](https://juliendubiel.net/)
as a PHP website containing documents. Now we want to expand it to mobile
applications with news and real-time notifications.

The back-end has changed from PHP to Python, Django.

I am in charge of the API, created using REST-Framework and the iPhone app,
using the iOS SDK.

This is work in progress.
