YolOCR is my first complex project involving algorithms and mathematics.
It's an Optical Character Recognition software, created during the second year
of EPITA, as a one-semester school project.

It's coded in OCaml using SDL (OCamlSDL).

Multiple steps were required :

* Image processing:
    * binarization (summed area table)
    * noise reduction (Otsu)
    * skew detection
    * rotation
        * variance of black pixels
        * bilinear interpolation

* Image segmentation:
    * block splitting
        * RLSA
        * tree-based block segmentation
