EpiTime is a schedule manager for IONIS students.

Originally an Android application
([Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.epitime)).
Using Chronos Webservice, EpiTime allows users to quickly check their schedule
(lectures, professors and classrooms), using a user-friendly interface and
taking advantage of all the iOS functions like Today widgets.

This is work in progress.
