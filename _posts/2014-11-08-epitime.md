EpiTime is a schedule manager for IONIS students.

Originally an [Android application](https://github.com/R-enaud/EpiTime) ([Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.epitime)) made by Gaubert Renaud, this is an iPhone version of it.

Using Chronos Webservice, EpiTime allows users to quickly check their schedule (lecture, professor and room), using a user-friendly interface and taking advantage of all the iOS functions like Today widgets.

This is work in progress.
