Foreign Jump is a runner-type video game.
The game is based on the concept of Temple Run.
The player has to jump to avoid the obstacles and get away from the enemy.

Created during the first year of EPITA,
as a school project with 3 other members.

This video game was developed using C# and Microsoft's XNA framework.
Along that, we used Xbox Live for the multi player
and a very basic AI for the enemy.
