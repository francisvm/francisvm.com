42sh is one of the biggest and most complex projects every EPITA student has to go through.

42sh was a 4-person group project for 3 weeks.

I was mostly in charge with the readline and the prompt, but I contributed to some other modules as well.

The different modules of the project were:

* Lexer/Parser
* Execution
* Builtins
* Readline
* Prompt

### Lexer / Parser
A lexer and a LL(1) parser had to be produced for this project.

### Execution
The execution part was the most complex one, since redirections and pipes were involved in the process.

### Builtins
The builtins were pretty fun to make, since it allowed us to discover some secrets of bash's builtins.

### Readline
The readline was a really challenging module since it was the only one that affects the user directly.
It had to be coded without the use of the full `ncurses` library, bur only with `Terminfo` and `Termcap`.
This module was the only interaction between the user and all the back-end that has been developed.

### Prompt
The prompt was the fun part. It allowed us to make our shell really sexy and to allow the user to customize his 42sh.



42sh is the perfect way to understand how your shell works. This allowed us to discover many secrets and many bash tricks.
