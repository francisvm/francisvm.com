summary:    x86 kernel

k is a simple kernel for the x86 architecture.

The project was started by the [LSE](https://lse.epita.fr/), by setting up the
bootloader and the build system.

The project was obviously done in C and assembly language.

### Protected mode
The kernel had to be set up to be running in protected mode.

### Events handling
The event handling, like the keyboard, or the timer was one of the most
interesting part.

I created interrupts and exception handlers, set up the PIC and export some
syscalls for the keyboard and the timer.

### Filesystem
The filesystem used by **k** is called the **kfs**.

```
Each file is represented by an inode, and the data is split in blocks.
```

### Binary loader
**k** is a mono-task kernel. It can load one ELF at a time, and execute it.

### Jump to userland
This is the part where the actual execution of a program starts.

After loading the ELF, we have to setup an userland environment for the
execution. This consists in setting up a stack, a heap and jump to an
unprivilegied mode of the OS.
