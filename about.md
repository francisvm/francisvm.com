### Resume
Make sure you check out [my resume](http://cv.francisvm.com/).

## Hi there !
My name is Francis Visoiu Mistrih, and I’m a developer from Paris, France. I am currently a student at EPITA in Paris.

### Studies
I’m studying Computer Science at an engineering school called EPITA, a private school in Paris. I study a lot of general engineering, like mathematics, physics, but also lots of algorithmics, architecture of systems and of course programmation.

### Programming
I started programming with OCaml, a great fonctional programming language by Inria, then finished my first year with C#. I have experience in working with the game engine XNA (check out [Foreign Jump]({{ site.projectsurl }}/foreignjump)).

Then, on my own time, I also started learning Objective-C and the iOS SDK, also with Cocos2D game engine and Box2D physics engine.

The most interesting period was the 3rd year of EPITA. That's when I learned C programming and low-level system programming on UNIX.

#### Programming languages
* C
* Objective-C (iOS)
* Python
* OCaml
