### Resume
Make sure you check out [my resume](http://cv.francisvm.com/).

## Hi there !
My name is Francis Visoiu Mistrih, and I’m a developer from Paris, France.
I am currently a student at EPITA in Paris.

### Studies
I’m studying Computer Science at an engineering school called EPITA,
a private school in Paris. I study a lot about general engineering,
like mathematics, physics, but also lots of algorithms,
architecture of systems and of course programming.

### Programming
I started programming with OCaml, a great functional programming language,
then finished my first year with C#,
which allowed me to work with the game engine XNA
(check out [Foreign Jump]({{ site.baseurl }}/2012/foreignjump)).

Then, in my free time, I started learning Objective-C and the iOS SDK.
Also, I coded Foreign Jump on iOS,
using Cocos2D game engine and Box2D physics engine.

The most interesting period was during the 3rd year of EPITA.
That's when the learning of real C programming and
low-level system programming on UNIX started.

I enjoy learning new stuff, and I currently work on many different projects.

#### Programming languages
* C
* Objective-C (iOS)
* Python
* OCaml
